A program that converts string representations of integers to literal integers using my own algorithm.

2. Open terminal and run the git clone command:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cramaechi/integer-converter.git
   ```
    or [download as ZIP](https://github.com/cramaechi/integer-converter/archive/master.zip).

3. Go to the project folder:

   ```
